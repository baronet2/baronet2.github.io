I recently graduated from the [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/what-is-engsci/) program at the University of Toronto, and am an incoming PhD student in Computer Science at [NYU Courant](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html) under [Andrew Gordon Wilson](https://cims.nyu.edu/~andrewgw/). My interests lie at the intersection between statistics and machine learning, and especially in deep representation learning methods.

I wrote my undergraduate thesis on information retrieval under [Scott Sanner](https://d3m.mie.utoronto.ca/members/ssanner/). Previously, I worked on sports analytics research under [Timothy Chan](https://chan.mie.utoronto.ca/) and on transportation planning under [Eric Miller](https://civmin.utoronto.ca/home/about-us/directory/professors/eric-miller/). I also spent 18 months at [Zelus Analytics](https://zelusanalytics.com/) working on soccer analytics, and in my free time served as an executive of the University of Toronto Sports Analytics student group ([UTSPAN](https://sportsanalytics.sa.utoronto.ca/)).
