I am a fourth-year Engineering Science student at the [University of Toronto](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/what-is-engsci/) majoring in Machine Intelligence.

I am completing my undergraduate thesis on the use of large language models in information retrieval under Prof. [Scott Sanner](https://d3m.mie.utoronto.ca/members/ssanner/) in the [Data-Driven Decision Making Lab](https://d3m.mie.utoronto.ca/). More generally, I am interested in the intersection between statistics and machine learning, and especially deep representation learning methods.

My other main research area is in sports analytics. I spent 16 months as a full-time data scientist with [Zelus Analytics](https://zelusanalytics.com/) and have conducted soccer analytics research under Prof. [Timothy Chan](https://chan.mie.utoronto.ca/). In my free time, I serve as an executive of the University of Toronto Sports Analytics student group ([UTSPAN](https://sportsanalytics.sa.utoronto.ca/)).

I have presented my sports analytics research at [MathSport International](http://www.mathsportinternational.com/index.html), CORS (where I won the [student paper competition](https://www.cors.ca/?q=content/student-paper-competition#3)), [NESSIS](https://www.nessis.org/nessis21.html), and the [Big Data Cup finals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcfcsO8A3k0) (where my group won the undegraduate category competition). Previously, I was a research assistant under Prof. [Eric Miller](https://civmin.utoronto.ca/home/about-us/directory/professors/eric-miller/) in the [University of Toronto Transportation Research Institute](https://uttri.utoronto.ca/), and presented my research on modelling travel demand and real estate prices at [TAC](https://www.tac-atc.ca/en/conference) and [NARSC](https://www.narsc.org/newsite/conference/).
