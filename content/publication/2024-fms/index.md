abstract: "We propose a foundation model for soccer, which is able to predict subsequent
actions in a soccer match from a given input sequence of actions. As a proof
of concept, we train a transformer architecture on three seasons of data from
a professional soccer league. We quantitatively and qualitatively compare the
performance of this transformer architecture to two baseline models: a Markov
model and a multi-layer perceptron. Additionally, we discuss potential applications
of our model. We provide an open-source implementation of our methods at
https://github.com/danielhocevar/Foundation-Model-for-Soccer."
