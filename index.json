Existing methods for reviewed-item retrieval (RIR), recently implemented by retrieval augmented generation (RAG) driven conversational recommendation systems, typically leverage late fusion (LF) – which computes query-item scores by simply averaging the top-K query-review similarity scores for an item. However, we demonstrate that for multi-aspect queries and multi-aspect items, LF is highly sensitive to the distribution of aspects covered by reviews in terms of aspect frequency and the degree of aspect separation across reviews. To address these LF failures, we propose several novel neural aspect fusion (AF) strategies which include LLM query extraction and generative reranking. Our experiments show that for imbalanced review corpora, AF can improve over LF by a 44% MAP increase from 0.36 ± 0.04 to 0.52 ± 0.04, while achieving equivalent performance for balanced review corpora.","tags":null,"title":"Multi-aspect reviewed-item retrieval via LLM query decomposition and aspect fusion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Ethan Baron**","Nathan Sandholtz","Devin Pleuler","Timothy C.

The introduction of more advanced data surrounding soccer shots has given rise to model-based metrics which better cope with these challenges. Specifically, metrics such as expected goals added, goals above expectation, and post-shot expected goals all use advanced data to offer an improvement over the classical conversion rate. However, all metrics developed to date assign a value of zero to off-target shots, which account for almost two-thirds of all shots, since these shots have no probability of scoring. We posit that there is non-negligible shooting skill signal contained in the trajectories of off-target shots and propose two shooting skill metrics that incorporate the signal contained in off-target shots. Specifically, we develop a player-specific generative model for shot trajectories based on a mixture of truncated bivariate Gaussian distributions. We use this generative model to compute metrics that allow us to attach non-zero value to off-target shots. We demonstrate that our proposed metrics are more stable than current state-of-the-art metrics and have increased predictive power.","tags":null,"title":"Miss it like Messi: Extracting value from off-target shots in soccer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Ethan Baron**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"c2f20721231cdddf529afed16a79a7d5","permalink":"https://baronet2.github.io/publication/2024-thesis.html","publishdate":"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2024-thesis.html","section":"publication","summary":"In this thesis, we explore three extensions to the standard information retrieval setting.\nFirstly, in some domains, it is common for users to seek items satisfying multiple independent aspects, expressed through multi-aspect queries. Classical information retrieval algorithms tend to perform poorly on such multi-aspect queries. Previously-proposed methods that explicitly account for multi-aspect structure offer only small improvements in performance over classical methods. We derive a principled algorithm based on a graphical model for multi-aspect retrieval and validate empirically that this algorithm improves performance on multi-aspect queries over classical approaches. Our algorithm offers performance competitive with large language model prompting at a more reasonable computational cost.\nSecondly, in many domains, information retrieval systems must leverage vast quantities of user-generated item reviews by effectively combining information about items from multiple user reviews. Past works propose two main branches of algorithms for this reviewed-item retrieval setting, but do not provide theoretical foundations for these algorithms. We formalize reviewed-item retrieval using a graphical model and draw connections between our model and previously-proposed methods, highlighting directions for future research motivated by these theoretical foundations.\nThirdly, we introduce multi-aspect reviewed-item retrieval, which combines the two previous extensions. We show intuitively and formally that multi-aspect queries pose a failure mode for state-of-the-art reviewed-item retrieval methods. We propose a novel reviewed-item retrieval algorithm to address this failure mode, and validate empirically that it achieves improved performance on multi-aspect queries. We also investigate the impact of various design choices for this algorithm.","tags":null,"title":"Multi-aspect reviewed-item retrieval","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In the continuity of my MSCA fellowship, I’ve been hired by the French CNRS (Section 11) as a tenured full time researcher at LIPhy (UGA).\n","date":1687996800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1687996800,"objectID":"d9cfc7a9d756d2a010e13ea6d11dcf56","permalink":"https://baronet2.github.io/news/2023-cnrs-start.html","publishdate":"2023-06-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/2023-cnrs-start.html","section":"news","summary":"I will be mainly working on the separation of fluid mixture using soft matter membrane, in LiPhy, Grenoble.","tags":["Personal"],"title":"I have obtained a position at French CNRS","type":"news"},{"authors":["**Ethan Baron**","Bram Janssens","Matthias Bogaert"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1687910400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1687910400,"objectID":"13013428412cb2c5fee86cfbcbc1112e","permalink":"https://baronet2.github.io/publication/2023-mathsport.html","publishdate":"2023-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023-mathsport.html","section":"publication","summary":"Vector embeddings have been successfully applied in several domains to obtain effective representations of non-numeric data which can then be used in various downstream tasks.
