The introduction of more advanced data surrounding soccer shots has given rise to model-based metrics which better cope with these challenges. Specifically, metrics such as expected goals added, goals above expectation, and post-shot expected goals all use advanced data to offer an improvement over the classical conversion rate. However, all metrics developed to date assign a value of zero to off-target shots, which account for almost two-thirds of all shots, since these shots have no probability of scoring. We posit that there is non-negligible shooting skill signal contained in the trajectories of off-target shots and propose two shooting skill metrics that incorporate the signal contained in off-target shots. Specifically, we develop a player-specific generative model for shot trajectories based on a mixture of truncated bivariate Gaussian distributions. We use this generative model to compute metrics that allow us to attach non-zero value to off-target shots. We demonstrate that our proposed metrics are more stable than current state-of-the-art metrics and have increased predictive power.","tags":null,"title":"Miss It Like Messi: Extracting Value from Off-Target Shots in Soccer","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In the continuity of my MSCA fellowship, I’ve been hired by the French CNRS (Section 11) as a tenured full time researcher at LIPhy (UGA).\n","date":1687996800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1687996800,"objectID":"d9cfc7a9d756d2a010e13ea6d11dcf56","permalink":"https://baronet2.github.io/news/2023-cnrs-start.html","publishdate":"2023-06-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/2023-cnrs-start.html","section":"news","summary":"I will be mainly working on the separation of fluid mixture using soft matter membrane, in LiPhy, Grenoble.","tags":["Personal"],"title":"I have obtained a position at French CNRS","type":"news"},{"authors":["**Ethan Baron**","Bram Janssens","Matthias Bogaert"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1687910400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1687910400,"objectID":"13013428412cb2c5fee86cfbcbc1112e","permalink":"https://baronet2.github.io/publication/2023-mathsport.html","publishdate":"2023-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023-mathsport.html","section":"publication","summary":"Vector embeddings have been successfully applied in several domains to obtain effective representations of non-numeric data which can then be used in various downstream tasks. We present a novel application of vector embeddings in professional road cycling by demonstrating a method to learn representations for riders and races based on historical results. We use unsupervised learning techniques to validate that the resultant embeddings capture interesting features of riders and races. These embeddings could be used for downstream prediction tasks such as early talent identification and race outcome prediction.","tags":null,"title":"Bike2Vec: Vector embedding representations of road cycling riders and race","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Ethan Baron**","Daniel Hocevar","Kabir Malik","Aaron White"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1656633600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656633600,"objectID":"6d27d0e17edeb3f2633d53e0569eb4e3","permalink":"https://baronet2.github.io/presentation/2022-bigdatacup.html","publishdate":"2022-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentation/2022-bigdatacup.html","section":"presentation","summary":"We propose a holistic player evaluation for hockey which leverages data to better represent players' value as a sum of the expected goal differential resulting from each of their actions.","tags":null,"title":"RIPP: Holistic player evaluation with region-based isolated player performance","type":"presentation"},{"authors":["**Ethan Baron**","Nathan Sandholtz","Devin Pleuler","Timothy C.

We compared the performance of random utility models (multinomial logistic regressions) and machine learning methods (random forest models), discussing the merits of each. Our key findings include the effectiveness of gravity models compared to more advanced accessibility models, important relationship between student’s living arrangement and school location choice, and the different patterns in behaviours of university and college students. We also find that while the random forest models obtain similar accuracy to the classic econometric tools, they are less suitable for predictive applications or extensions to unseen data.","tags":null,"title":"Modelling GTHA post-secondary school location choice","type":"publication"}]
